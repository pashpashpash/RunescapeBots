# Old School Runescape bots built using Dreambot client APIs.
To run any of these bots, please make sure you have the latest version of the [Dreambot](https://dreambot.org/) client running.
If you're new to RS Botting or have any suggestions, feel free to tweet me [@pashmerepat](https://twitter.com/pashmerepat).
Some of you asked to add pre-compiled versions that you can directly run in Dreambot, you can find them all in the [/ExportedScripts](https://github.com/pashpashpash/RunescapeBots/tree/master/ExportedScripts) folder.

After a couple weeks of testing, I found that alternating activities is a tremendously effective anti-ban technique. I have been running this script successfully without being banned for multiple days now (with breaks between runs), so please enjoy & post proggies if yâ€™all donâ€™t mind ðŸ™‚

Feature List

* Sexy, easy to understand script config UI

Antiban, by Zen
Robust anti-pattern system that randomizes various activities while botting.
* Examine random entities (objects, npcs, ground and inventory items etc)
* Check a random stat (you can tell it which stats to check with antiban.setStatsToCheck(Skill.ATTACK, Skill.DEFENCE);)
* Type something random (gibberish)
* Move the mouse to a random location (and sometimes click the left or right button)
* Walk to a random location nearby
* Chop a random tree nearby
* Click on a random entity (object, npc, item etc.)
* Go AFK for a while (turns off autologin and random solvers temporarily)
* Open your inventory
* Open your stats menu
* Open your magic menu
* Open your combat menu (only if you have included Melee stats in your Stats to Check)
* Move the mouse off-screen for a while
* Move the camera randomly
